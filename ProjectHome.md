OpenSMT is an open source storage management toolkit based on opensolaris. Consider an opensolaris system with OpenSMT to be some storage devices, which are specialized for sharing files over the network. By aid of Sun Open Storage, OpenSMT turns a ordinary x86/64 architecture system into a NAS/SAN appliance. An important topic for OpenSMT is to be cost-effective. It is very simple to deploy OpenSMT on a server or even a PC. And the operation of OpenSMT is designed to be convenient as far as possible.
Through its web GUI, it is simple to modify several storage services on the data server. This access flexibility of OpenSMT ensures every user is able to manipulate his storage from any platform if only the network and browser are available. Besides, it also provides common access management and some useful tools for displaying system and network statistics, including information of CPU, memory, IP and so on.
Compared to other similar projects, OpenSMT also addresses some special storage concerns. Due to the powerful file system ZFS, operations for a storage system have been greatly simplified. And we provide an all-round ZFS management module for manipulating your zpools conveniently. Also there are many more familiar common functions in OpenSMT, like setting related services and shared directories.
