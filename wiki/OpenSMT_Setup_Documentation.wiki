OpenSMT Setup Documentation

1. install web stack.
   command: pfexec pkg install amp-dev

   command: pfexec pkg install storage-server SUNWiscsit.

3. copy file opensmt/httpd.conf to /etc/apache2/2.2/httpd.conf to overlap orginal apache configurations.

4. copy opensmt to /var/apache2/2.2/htdocs and change the authority to 777(type command: chmod -R 777 /var/apache2/2.2/htdocs/opensmt).

    chmod -R 777 /etc/sfw

    chmod -R 777 /etc/ftpd

    chmod -R 777 /etc/apache2/2.2

    chmod -R 777 /etc/default

    chmod -R 777 /etc/ssh

    chmod -R 777 /etc/rsyncd.conf
